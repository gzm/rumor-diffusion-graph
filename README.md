Understanding of Information Diffusion Algorithms on Graph   

  In wireless and sensor networks, we need to sum and aggregate data. For this, gossip based algorithms (Push, Pull, Push-Pull algorithms), which is an independent solution from the used environment. The diffusion of data on network is modelled by the mathematical model of epidemics. At my study, I will use this model and related algorithms(Push, Pull, Push-Pull algorithms) to examine diffusion an information on a graph. In this way, I aim to reach information and experiment results that which algorithm is more efficient solution under which circumstances. According to these result; the most suitable algorithms can be chosen for data aggregation on wireless and sensor networks or data synchronization among distributed database implementations. Additionally, this is a research project on data aggregation on random graph. With this facility the results can be used for many application development such as on social networks, wireless or sensor networks and data synchronization of distributed databases.
